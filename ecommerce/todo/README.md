# Todo

A domain responsible for tasks, completion of them etc.

#### Up and running

```
make install test mutate
```


### Domain knowledge

Tasks are meant here like in any todo app - nozbe, todoist etc
However, the boundary here is clear - all time related things don't belong here.
Similarly, it's not about assigning tasks to people nor to projects.

It's mostly about a lifecycle of task.
